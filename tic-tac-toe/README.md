## Tic Tac Toe JavaScript Exercises for ITA staff

1. Phase one will introduce the basic game patterns to understand the implementation mechanics.
  - Closures and internal variable storage on initialized functions
  - Scoping and protection states using the Revealing Module pattern
  - Function as first class objects with Array.foreach()and Array.filter()
  - DOM Fragment creation and event binding
    
2. Step two will implement the algorithmic computer player to acheive and unbeatable opponent.
  - Object composition and initialization through the constructor function pattern.
  - Object state manipulation and context
  - Logic abstraction and testing
  - Additional DOM manipulation techniques
  - Application design and layering techniques

3. Step three will introduce tiered architecture design by abstracting logic and computation to a service layer interfaced over http
  - Asynchronous http request handling
  - Additional exposure to seperation of concerns and layering patterns
  - Object composition vs initialization
  - Other types of js objects and syntax for composition, initialization and extension
